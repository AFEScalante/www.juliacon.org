  <h2>Invitation to Julia</h2>
  <p><em>David P. Sanders</em></p>
  <p>A 3-hour revised and updated version of my
     <a href="http://juliacon.org/2015/workshops.html#wednesday">tutorial</a> from last year's JuliaCon,
     with an emphasis on slightly more advanced topics that I didn't get to talk about then,
     including defining types and metaprogramming.</p>

  <h2>Introduction to Writing High Performance Julia</h2>
  <p><em>Arch D. Robison</em></p>
  <p>This workshop is an introduction to writing high performance code in Julia.
     We'll start with a high level view of the hardware and Julia,
     and how Julia semantics differ from languages such as C/C++/Fortran.
     Next we'll cover how Julia compiles your program, from your source text down to the machine instructions.
     The key is to make Julia's type-inference work for you instead of against you, and cater to the hardware.
     We'll also look at "deals with the devil" annotations (<tt>@inbounds</tt>, <tt>@fastmath</tt>, <tt>@simd</tt>)
     so that you understand the trade you make with those annotations.
     Finally, we'll look the art of writing vectorizable code, which brings many of the topics together.
     Overall, the goal is to understand what you need to do, and what to leave to the compiler, to get high preforming code.

     Attendees are encouraged to bring a computer with Julia to try exercises that involve speeding up slow examples.</p>

  <h2>Plots with Plots</h2>
  <p><em>Tom Breloff</em></p>
  <p>A hands-on workshop of how to hack visualizations with <tt>Plots.jl</tt> and the various backends it supports. </p>

  <h2>Creating, Distributing, and Testing Julia Packages with Binary Dependencies</h2>
  <p><em>Tony Kelman</em></p>
  <p>I will cover the process and tools for creating Julia packages that wrap C (or Fortran) libraries.
     Working through a small example I will cover how to initially get basic functionality working
     interactively from the REPL, then structure the code as a Julia package.
     We will begin working from a single development platform,
     then proceed to show how to build, distribute, and leverage automated
     testing tools to get the C library and wrapper Julia package working
     across common Linux distributions, Mac OS X, and Windows.
     Time permitting I might work through a Python-wrapper example,
     and even Java if we want to get really ambitious.</p>
