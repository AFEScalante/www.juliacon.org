    Are you new to Julia?! This introductory workshop should be accessible to anyone with technical computing needs and some experience with another programming language. We will show you why Julia is special, demonstrate how easy Julia is to learn, and get you writing Julia code.

    In the first half of this tutorial, we will briefly introduce the language, giving attendees a sense of why Julia is special and what needs Julia meets. After that, we will show how easy it is to pick up Julia’s syntax, covering string manipulation, data structures, loops, conditionals, and functions.

    In the second half of this tutorial, we will illustrate Julia’s speed, power, and expressiveness. Among other things, we will look at Julia’s generic linear algebra infrastructure, benchmark Julia against C and Python, and discuss how Julia’s design paradigm leads to flexible performance.

    Exercises to ingrain concepts will be included throughout the tutorial with an integrative exercise at the end.
