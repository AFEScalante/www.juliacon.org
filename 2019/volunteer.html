<h1>Roles</h1>
  <h3>Talk submission reviewers</h3>
    <p>
        Once the Call for Proposals closes, we expect to have order of 200 proposals to 
        review, each of which will require at least three pairs of eyes. Help us create a 
        fair and expedient review process by agreeing to read and score a set of talk 
        proposals, and then discuss your evaluation with other volunteers.
    </p>
    <h3>Financial assistance application reviewers</h3>
    <p>
        We are currently looking for volunteers to review financial assistance applications,
        publicized on our <a href="https://juliacon.org/2019/financial-assistance/">financial 
        assistance</a> page. These applications are shorter in length, so we expect reviewers to 
        review all applications (about 60) and rate them according to a rubric we will provide. 
        If the need arises, we may need to have conference calls to discuss certain cases 
        individually.
    </p>
    <h3>Local /On-site volunteers</h3>
    <p>
        Our on-site volunteers help keep the conference running smoothly by helping with items 
        like registration and set-up at the venue. Help us put on a great event for our community!
