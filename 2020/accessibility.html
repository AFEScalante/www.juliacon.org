<h1>Accessibility at JuliaCon</h1>
  <p>
    JuliaCon is committed to providing an accessible and inclusive environment to every attendee. In light of our
	<a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/covid19/">announcement</a> to shift JuliaCon online, we shall ensure that all our talks will
	include automated closed captioning.

    Please reach out to Ranjan Anantharaman, the Accessibility Chair at juliacon@julialang.org for any
	additional concerns.
